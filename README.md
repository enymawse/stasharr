# Add StashID to Whisparr

This Tampermonkey userscript allows you to add a StashDB scene to your local Whisparr instance with a single click. It automatically checks if the scene is already in Whisparr and displays appropriate messages.

## Features

- **One-click integration**: Add scenes from StashDB directly to Whisparr.
- **Feedback notifications**: Displays toast notifications for successful actions or errors.
- **Dynamic button injection**: Automatically adds the button when the relevant scene information is available.

## Installation

2. **Add the script**:
   - Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser.
   - Select "Create a new script."
   - Replace the default code with the content of this script.
   - Save the script.

## Configuration
