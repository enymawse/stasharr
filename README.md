![Settings Modal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8748c1c0-7029-47d4-a9e3-7f68957b07af)

### Settings Guide

#### **General Settings**

- **Link Behavior** — Choose whether external links open in new tabs (recommended) or current tab
- Visual indicators show which links will open in new tabs

#### **Whisparr Configuration**

- **Domain** — Your Whisparr instance URL
  - Examples: `localhost:6969`, `whisparr.lan`, `whisparr.yourdomain.com:8989`
  - Supports HTTP/HTTPS, custom ports, and reverse proxy setups
- **API Key** — Found in Whisparr → Settings → General
- **Quality Profile** — Auto-populated after successful connection
- **Root Folder** — Auto-populated after successful connection
- **Tags** — Optional tags to apply to downloaded content

#### **Stash Integration** (Optional)

- **Domain** — Your Stash instance URL (same format as Whisparr)
- **API Key** — Found in Stash → Settings → Configuration → Authentication

### Advanced Configuration

#### **Reverse Proxy Users**

Stasharr automatically detects reverse proxy setups and applies smart defaults:

- **Domains ending in** `.lan`, `.local`, `.home`, etc. → Defaults to HTTPS
- **Custom ports** → Optional for reverse proxy domains
- **Path preservation** → Maintains custom paths like `/stash` or `/whisparr`

#### **HTTPS vs HTTP**

- **HTTPS** — Automatically selected for reverse proxy domains and public URLs
- **HTTP** — Used for localhost and private IP addresses
- **Override** — Use the protocol toggle to force HTTP if needed (e.g., for self-signed certificates)

### Permission Requests

When you first configure Whisparr/Stash domains, your browser will request permission to access those sites. **Always click "Always allow domain"** to ensure proper functionality.

![Scene Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a137640b-b87f-4042-a27a-dd7de9f39656)

#### **Status Indicators**

- 🟢 **Green (Downloaded)** — Scene exists in Whisparr with file
- 🟡 **Yellow (Monitored)** — Scene exists in Whisparr, actively searching
- 🔴 **Red (Excluded)** — Scene is on your exclusion list
- 🟣 **Purple (Add)** — Scene not in Whisparr, click to add

#### **Available Actions**

- **Add Scene** — One-click addition to Whisparr
- **View in Whisparr** — Direct link to scene in your Whisparr instance
- **View in Stash** — Direct link to scene in your Stash instance (if configured)
- **Copy Scene ID** — Copy StashDB scene ID to clipboard

### Bulk Operations

![Bulk Actions](docs/images/bulk-actions-dropdown.png)

On any StashDB page showing multiple scenes, the Stasharr Actions dropdown provides three bulk tools:

- **Add All on Page:** Adds all available scenes on the current page to Whisparr
- **Search All on Page:** Triggers a search for all monitored scenes on the current page in Whisparr
- **Add All Missing:** Finds and adds scenes missing from your Whisparr library based on context (page/studio/performer)

What you’ll see during bulk operations:

- **Progress Modal:** Centralized progress with overall progress bar, per-item status, and final summary
- **Scene Titles:** Items show human-readable scene titles (not hashes)
- **Skipped Info:** Shows how many were skipped with reason “already in Whisparr”
- **Clear Empty-State:** If there’s nothing to do, the modal shows an info message (no false “1/1 succeeded”)
- **Confirmation:** Each action shows a confirmation dialog before executing

### Studio & Performer Management

Visit any studio or performer page to:

- **Toggle monitoring** with the bookmark icon
- **Add new entities** to Whisparr if they don't exist
- **View real-time status** updates

### Settings Management

Access settings anytime by clicking **"Stasharr"** in the top navigation. Settings are:

- **Automatically validated** as you type
- **Saved instantly** when valid
- **Backed up locally** in your browser
- **Synchronized** across tabs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Settings Won't Save**

- Verify your Whisparr instance is accessible from your browser
- Check that the API key is correct (found in Whisparr → Settings → General)
- Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection

#### **Buttons Not Appearing**

- Refresh the StashDB page
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Verify userscript is enabled in your extension

#### **Permission Denied Errors**

- Re-run the domain permission process in your userscript manager
- Ensure you clicked "Always allow domain" when prompted
- Check that the domain matches exactly (including protocol and port)

#### **Tooltips Stuck on Screen**

- This has been fixed in v2.9.0+
- Update to the latest version if you're experiencing this issue

### Getting Help

#### **Before Reporting Issues**

1. **Update to latest version** — Many issues are resolved in newer releases
2. **Check browser console** — Look for error messages (F12 → Console)
3. **Test basic connectivity** — Verify you can access Whisparr directly in your browser
4. **Review settings** — Ensure all configuration is correct

#### **Whisparr Version Requirements**

Stasharr requires **Whisparr v3+**. If you're running v2, update with:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hotio/whisparr:v3
